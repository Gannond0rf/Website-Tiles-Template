# Layout Guide

* Cells are laid out in left to right, top to bottom order.
* Images do not need to be cropped, they'll adjust to fit the container with no gaps.
* Images should not be larger than 1872px wide - 4K probably unnecessary. Save with jpeg quality 10 in photoshop.
* All images should go in the ```content/grid-images``` folder. This folder can then be uploaded to the same folder on the sever when done. The URLs in your template will not need to be changed on the live server.
* Breakpoints are currently using the browser window size and breaks at 768px. This will likely stay this way until container queries are a proper thing although the breakpoint can be changed.
